PetFinder - readme

This Application will allow the user to search for Pets in a given database,
using attributes like type, breed, size, age, and where they are located.

Please compile and execute the file called "Driver" to run the program,
and follow the prompts given in the console to search for the desired pet.

Though implementing GUI was an additional option in the assignment,
due to time constraints I have decided to only submit a text-based project.
