Initial design with classes, variables, and method signatures.
Final design may change without this file being changed, as needs arise.

Class Song implements Comparable
	private String name, artist, filePath, album
	
	Song(String n, String a, String f, String al);
	
	getters and setters
	
	public String toString();
	
	public int compareTo(Song other);

Class Library
	//handles the storing of songs, and library textFile i/o
	
	private ArrayList
	//two are needed if searching by album
	
	Library();  //creates the HashMap
	
	public void inputFromDT();
	//gets traverse method in DirectoryTraverser to add song files to file ArrayList
	
	public ArrayList<Song> search(String s);

	public void loadLibrary(String file);
	
	public void saveLibrary(String fileName);
	
	public Iterator<Song> libraryIterator();
		//allows the library to be iterated over but not directly changed

Class PlayerThread extends Thread
	
	Player pl;
	
	PlayerThread(String fileName);
	//will have to read more about this before writing

Class DirectoryTraverser
	import jAudiotagger (whatever real path is)
	
	//need to learn/read a little more about this	
	//recursively traverses all files and subdirectories in mp3.
	//pulls the tag info from the songs and pushes to Library via inputFromDT();

Class MainPanel
	//see starter code; other things will be added as needs arise.
